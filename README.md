<h1 align="center">Welcome to My Chip 8 Interpreter/Emulator!</h1>
<h3 align="center">First C++ Project</h3>

I've always wanted to dive into developing an emulator and multiple posts recommend
to get your feet wet with the chip 8. Multiple routines are based off the ones present
in video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW1zXX89pfM&list=PLT7NbkyNWaqbyBMzdySdqjnfUFxt8rnU_&index=2,
however, coming from a C# background I'm mostly familiar with OOP so I decided to practice
it on C++ by adding classes. Please note this is my first project on C++ and some routines might be (weird)!
